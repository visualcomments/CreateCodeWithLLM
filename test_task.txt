    Task: Implement a sorting algorithm that sorts a given vector using ONLY allowed swaps.

    Input: A vector `a` of length `n` (0-indexed).

    Allowed operations:
    - swap(i, i+1) for i = 0..n-2 (adjacent swap)
    - swap(n-1, 0) â€” a circular swap between the last and the first element

    Strict constraints:
    - No other swaps, slicing, built-in sorting functions, or creating new arrays are allowed.
    - All swaps must be appended to the `swaps` list immediately after performing them.
    - Applying the swaps sequentially to a copy of the input vector must yield a fully sorted ascending array.
    - Circular swaps can ONLY be performed as swap(n-1, 0), never as swap(i, n-1-i) or any other non-adjacent pair.

    Critical clarification:
    - Circular swaps may be used multiple times as needed during the sorting process.
    - The sorting algorithm must continue applying swaps until the array is fully sorted.

    Requirements:
    1. Implement a function `solve(vector)` that returns a tuple `(swaps, sorted_array)`:
        - `swaps` is a list of tuples representing all swaps performed.
        - `sorted_array` is the final sorted array after applying all swaps to a copy of the input vector.
    2. Include a CLI interface:
        - When the script is executed directly, it should accept a vector as a **command-line argument**.
        - The output should be a **JSON object** with keys `"swaps"` and `"sorted_array"`.
    3. Include a minimal example in the `__main__` block for quick testing.
    4. The code must be fully self-contained and executable without external dependencies.
    5. JSON output must always be structured and parseable for automated testing.

    Example expected usage:

    ```bash
    python solve_module.py "[3,1,2,5,4]"
