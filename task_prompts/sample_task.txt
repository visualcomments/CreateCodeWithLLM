You are given an array of integers. Write a Python program that reads JSON from sys.argv[1] with a key "arr", 
and outputs a JSON to stdout with keys:
- "sorted": the input array sorted ascending
- "moves": a list of swap operations that your algorithm performed, where each move is [i, j] (0-based indices)

Constraints:
- The program must terminate.
- Your output must be valid JSON.

Edge cases to consider:
- empty array
- singleton
- already sorted
- reverse sorted
- arrays with duplicates
